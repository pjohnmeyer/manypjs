# An Introduction

A few months ago, I tweeted this:

## A bit about the site

At the time of this writing, this site is being hosted by GitHub using
GitHub Pages. However, the site is generated by its own static
generator, built by me, just for this site. You can see everything on
[the GitHub project page](https://github.com/pjohnmeyer/manypjs) if
you care to; I intend to leave it public. My goal in this is not to
create a new generator for the world to use, though, but rather to
build a site generator customized to my liking. I elected to do this
as a learning experience. I have nothing against the
Octopress / Jekyll / GitHub Pages "native" ecosystem, or any of
the other static generators out there.

The generator is being written in Ruby, and so far the only
dependencies I have taken on are `bundler`, `commonmark`, `minitest`,
and `rake`.

## Expectations

My goal is simple: to write, to learn, and to share.
