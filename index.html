<h1>Many PJs</h1>

<p>I am presently working on the first couple of posts for this site,
and for some silly reason I'm also writing my own static site
generator for it. So, yeah, I'm having a little fun but it might take
a hot minute to get this rolling.</p>

<p>If you're really really interested for some reason, here is a link
to my <a href='posts/an-introduction.html'>work in progress first post.
</a></p>

<p>Many PJs will be home to my writings on the <em>many</em> facets of
my life, thus the name. It will likely have an emphasis on software
development and my projects &mdash; yes, yet another coding blog. I'm
sorry, Internet. But, I don't plan on restricting it to that.</p>

<p>For now, if you're interested in following updates, my best
recommendation is to watch <a href="https://github.com/pjohnmeyer/manypjs">
the GitHub repository for the site</a>. Once RSS is available I'll do
my best to make sure that is known.</p>
